### Music Genres Recognition using Neural Networks

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to model a music classification task using the GTZAN dataset (available in Kaggle). It comprises 100 audio samples of 30 seconds each for 10 different music genres. Visual representations of each music sample are fed to the CNN as inputs.

The CNN model is trained using data augmentation tecnhiques along with regularization techniques, resulting in an accuracy of 84% and loss of 0.52 for the test.
