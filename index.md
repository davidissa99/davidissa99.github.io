### Music Genres Recognition using Neural Networks

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to model a music classification task employing The GTZAN dataset (available in Kaggle). It comprises 100 audio samples for 10 different music genres, with each sample having a duration of 30 seconds. Visual representations of each music sample are fed to the CNN as inputs, meaning audio data is transformed into images.

An accuracy of 84% and loss of 0.52 for the test set are obtained. The CNN model is trained using data augmentation tecnhiques along with regularization techniques to ensure model performance is boosted and no overfitting is observed.
